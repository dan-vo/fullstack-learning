    <h1>A Day in the Life of a Software Engineer</h1>
    <div>
      Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away, there lived a <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering”>software engineer</a> named Alex. Every day, Alex embarked on a journey filled with
      coding adventures, <a href=”ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug”
      >bugs</a>, to conquer, and <a href=”ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug”
      >coffee</a> to fuel the mind.
    </div>

    />
    <div>
      One fine morning, Alex sat down at the computer, ready to tackle the day's
      tasks. <span class="font-big">But alas!</span> The code refused to compile, and the bugs seemed to
      multiply like <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit”
      >rabbits</a> in a magic hat. With a sigh, Alex dove deep into the
      code, armed with determination and a trusty stack overflow.
    </div>

    />
    <div>
      As lunchtime approached, Alex emerged from the coding abyss, victorious!
      The bugs were squashed, and the code ran smoother than a buttered-up
      slide. But just as Alex reached for the celebratory pizza, an urgent email
      arrived: "<a class="font-big" href=”ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug”
      >Emergency bug</a> fix required! <span class="text code-meltdown">Code meltdown</span> imminent!"
    </div>
    <div>
      With a <span class="text heavy-heart">heavy heart</span> and a rumbling stomach, Alex returned to the
      battlefield. The hours ticked by, but so did the lines of code. With each
      keystroke, Alex grew stronger, wiser, and slightly more caffeinated.
    </div>
    <div>
      Finally, as the clock struck midnight, <span class="font-big text victory">victory was declared</span>! The bug was
      banished, the code was pristine, and Alex emerged from the coding cave,
      triumphant once more. With weary eyes and a satisfied grin, Alex closed
      the laptop and bid farewell to another day in the life of a <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering”>software engineer</a>.
