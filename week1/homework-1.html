    <h1>The Coding Adventure</h1>
    <p>
      Once upon a time in the kingdom of JavaScript, there lived a coder named
      Bob. Bob was on a quest to conquer the mighty

      img.addEventListener('click', function () {
        alert('Bob is clicked');
      });
    </script>

    <p>
      Armed with his keyboard and a mug of coffee, Bob bravely faced syntax
      monsters and wrestled with the elusive null dragons. But his greatest
      nemesis was the mighty

      With a clever strategy and a sprinkle of humor, Bob defeated the Bug Queen
      and emerged victorious. The kingdom celebrated with joyous console logs,
      and Bob became a legendary coder known for his wit and coding prowess.
